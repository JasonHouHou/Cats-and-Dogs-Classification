# Cats and Dogs Image Classification
STAD68 Final Project Kaggle Competition: 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-vs-cat-classification

This competition revolves around a classic image classification problem, where the goal is to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. Specifically, we need to develop a model that can classify each image into one of the two categories (cat or dog). We used convolutional neural networks or other advanced deep learning architectures to extract meaningful features from the images and make accurate predictions. The performance of the model will be evaluated using classification accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images in the test set. The higher our score, the better our model is at distinguishing between cats and dogs.

Model Used:
- Simple CNN
- Deep CNN
- Skip Connections ResNet
- Transfer Learning VGG16
- Applied Batch Normalization, Dropout, and L2 Regularization to improve performance and prevent overfitting
